# uxinspo

uxinspo is a curated collection of web app UIs. Take inspiration from hundreds of SaaS application UIs from real companies.

# To Do

-   [ ] Let users submit links to SaaS products
-   [ ] Show the hero section only on the home page
-   [ ] Open designs in Lightbox on the home page and the category page. (`category/[slug]` page seems like an unnecessary page navigation. I could always show the details on a custom lightbox component.)
-   [ ] Add animations
